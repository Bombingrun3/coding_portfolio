      <h2>
        Hey there — I'm Ryan, a full stack developer with a passion for building
        clean, responsive web apps that are both functional and enjoyable to
        use. I work mainly with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React,
        Node.js) and enjoy diving into both front-end design and back-end logic.
        I’m always learning something new, whether that’s a fresh JavaScript
        library, a UI framework, or just a better way to write code. I love
        solving problems, building cool things from scratch, and collaborating
        with others to bring ideas to life.
